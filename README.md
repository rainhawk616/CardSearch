# Synopsis
This project is a simple card searching website for collectable card games.
# Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
# Motivation
I enjoy collectable card games as a hobby but haven’t found a search tool I enjoy using when deck building.  I’ve started to write this site as a means to learn a bit about Node and Express as well as provide some search features I’m interested in seeing.
# Installation
This project requires a PostgreSQL database version 9.4+ and NPM
Also certain environment variables (or a .env file at the root of the project) are required to supply certain variables that the code looks for, including database connection information.
#Special Thanks
A special thanks to the MTG JSON, Keyrune, and Mana projects for providing the resources to help make this site.
